# ValueNet: House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

##  Project Objective
The objective of **ValueNet** is to build a machine learning model that can predict house prices based on various features like area, number of rooms, and location. By using Linear Regression, this project aims to provide a simple yet effective solution for price estimation in the real estate domain.

##  Abstract
Accurate house price prediction is critical for buyers, sellers, and investors in the real estate industry. This project utilizes a Linear Regression model to analyze historical housing data and find patterns between property features and their prices. Once trained, the model can estimate the price of a house based on its attributes.

##  Methodology

1. **Data Collection**  
   Collection of a housing dataset with relevant features such as:
   - Area (sq. ft)
   - Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
   - Location
   - Other relevant attributes

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis and modeling.

3. **Model Training**  
   Training a **Linear Regression** model using Python libraries.

4. **Prediction**  
   Predicting house prices on new/unseen data using the trained model.
